            Entropy Labs is building the infrastructure to enable Scalable Oversight, in pursuit of safe and effective agentic AI.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Using both automated and manual review of agent actions, we're aiming to enable large fleets of agents to operate on the internet, whilst providing granular observability into the agents and their operating environments.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Use case</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2">
            <li>You're a an AI lab evaluating the capabilities of agents at scale in high-risk domains. You want to have absolute control over what actions are executed on the world without having to manually review everything your agents do</li>
            <li>You're a research scientist that wants to evaluate the efficacy of new control methods for agentic systems</li>
            <li>You're a developer building an AI pipeline and you want to deploy an early agent to your customers and iteratively improve it and avoid embarassing failures</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How?</h2>
          <p>
            To do this we're building an pluggable <b>Approval Manager</b> that integrates into your agent in a few lines of code. The Approval Manager integrates with a suite of <b>Approvers</b> to automate the detection, blocking and approval of actions. These Approvers monitor network requests, executed commands and actions taken in headless browsers, and can intelligently approve or block agent actions and escalate to human review when necessary.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You don't have to use our Approvers, you can write your own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With an Approval Manager we can orchestrate multiple Approvers, handling escalations for a layered approach to oversight, combining automated checks with human intervention when necessary.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The challenge</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Increasingly capable agentic AI systems with web access and code execution abilities present new challenges that existing zero-trust oversight techniques are ill-equipped to handle.</p>
          <p>We're transitioning into a world where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>highly capable agents will be writing and executing arbitrary code autonomously</li>
            <li>agents that can operate at millions of requests per second will be <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://www.skyfire.xyz">making payments</a> on your behalf</li>
            <li>agents will be interacting with humans in <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://www.netcraft.com/news/netcraft-announces-new-ai-powered-innovations/">negotations without human oversight</a></li>
            <li>agents will self-heal and evolving during runtime</li>


          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">Current oversight techniques used for agentic systems like continuous human monitoring are not a viable long term solution as we move towards clusters of millions of agents performing economically useful activity on the internet. It is imperative that those deploying agents in the wild have the ability to detect and avoid problematic or unintended behaviors of their systems. Lack of these systems will hinder confident deployment in real-world scenarios and limit the usefulness of agent research and activity. Our platform addresses the following key challenges:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>There are no good solutions to real-time monitoring of AI agent actions</li>
            <li>Approval mechanisms for accepting or rejecting agent actions are primitive and inflexible</li>
            <li>Lack of high-fidelity monitoring and oversight makes managing large-scale agent evaluations hard</li>
            <li>Lack of a standardized framework for implementing oversight across different AI systems</li>
          </ul>
